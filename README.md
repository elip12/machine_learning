# machine_learning
python machine learning algorithms (linear regression, SVMs, neural nets, etc)

I wrote all of this code myself, but I learned about machine learning and how to
implement it in python on pythonprogramming.net, from the Practical Machine
Learning with Python tutorial series. Thanks!
