# machine_learning
Some python machine learning algorithms (linear regression, SVMs, etc).

This is for fun and to help me learn about machine learning and AI.

I wrote all of this code myself, but I learned about machine learning and how to
implement it in python on pythonprogramming.net, from the Practical Machine
Learning with Python tutorial series. Thanks!
